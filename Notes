Scopes
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The name for the kind of scope that exists in a nested relationship is called ChieldScope
Another scope that exists inside Angular is called RootScope

Scope can Heir from Root to Parent to Child
Bind variables from Parent to Child Scopes but not the other way around.
Trying to set values on parent scope variables from Child Scopes results in a copy of the variable being created on the Child Scope
